🧠 Self-Hosting SearXNG with Open WebUI on Windows using Docker 
A beginner-friendly guide to integrate SearXNG (meta search engine) with Open WebUI for search using Docker on Windows

---
📌 Goal
Integrate SearXNG as a web search provider for Open WebUI, enabling
local LLMS to perform online search queries. We aim to:

Self-host SearXNG using Docker

Connet SearXNG to Open WebUI

Solve issues like forbidden errors, DNS issues, and lack of results

Keep the solution beginner-friendly and up-to-date

---
🧰Prerequisites
Docker Desktop installed on Windows
Basic knowledge of Docker containers
Both Open WebuUI and SearXNG running as separate Docker containers

---
⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup
1.🔹Run SearXNG in Docker
You can pull and run the official SearXNG image:
docker run -d --name searxng -p 8081:8080 -v searxng_data:/etc/searxng searxng/searxng
after this, SearXNG should be accessible at:
http://localhost:8081

2.🔹 Enable Web Search Support in Open WebUI
Open WebUI setting and add the SearXNG API URL under the Web
Search section:
http://host.docker.internal:8081/search?q={query}&format=json
host.docker.internal is Docker's way to access the Windows host from a container on Windows/Mac

---
🔧Key Configuration in settings.yml
Navigate inside the container or your mapped volume:
Location:/etc/searxng/settings.yml
Required Edits:

server:
 bind_address:
secret_key: "your-secret-key"

#Add this to allow Open WebUI to communicate with SearXNG
allowed_hosts:
 -"*"
-"localhost"
-"host.docker.internal"

search:
 formats:
  -html
  -json #✅ Add this line

save the file after editing.

🌐 Fixing Internet Issues in SearXNG
If your SearXNG container shows no search results, it likely can't 
access the internet.

✅ Fix:
Open Docker Desktop -> Settings -> Resources -> Network
Enable Host Networking 
Click Apply & Restart

---
🔁 Why a Full System Restart Helped
After config changes, your containers or Docker DNS cache might 
reset immediately. Restarting your computer:
Clears cached DNS entries
Restarts Docker daemon
Reloads container configuration

This fixed issues like:
Forbidden errors
host.docker.internal not found
Seach result not showing

---
✅ Final Working Setup
SearXNG running in Docker on port 8081
Edited settings.yml with allowed_host and json support
Open WebUI Docker container pointing to:
http://host.docker.internal:8081/search?q={query}&format=json
Docker network setting adjusted
System rebooted to apply changes

---
🧪Testing
1. Visit in browser:
http://localhost:8081/search?q=Iron+man&format=json
You should see JSON results.

2.Inside Open WebUI, perform a web search prompt. It should show 
result fetched from your local SearchXNG.
